    "They suggest: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Always begin with a “core” set of predictors that have theoretical relevance, as well as any predictors whose effects you are specifically interested in. You may estimate a “quick and dirty” OLS model at this time. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Finalize model specification issues (e.g., log vs. linear – to be discussed in a later note) \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Add additional predictors that you think might be relevant. You can add them one at a time or one “category” at a time (see next section). Check for the robustness of your initial findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) When adding predictors, you should keep all the original predictors in the model, even if they were not significant. Remember, omitted variable bias can cause significant predictors to appear to be insignificant. By adding more variables, your key predictors may become significant. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) At this point, you should know your robust findings. That is the main goal of your research. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) If you insist on producing a “final model”, then you should remove those additional predictors that were not remotely significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7) You can also remove core predictors if they remain insignificant and you need degrees of freedom. If you are not taxed for degrees of freedom, you may want to keep your core variables, if only to paint the entire picture for your audience."
